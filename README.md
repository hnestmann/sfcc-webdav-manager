## Usage

### First Time Setup

2. Click the "Connect" button or "Add Connection" in the sidebar
3. Fill in your connection details:
   - **Connection Name**: A friendly name for your SFCC instance
   - **WebDAV URL**: Your SFCC WebDAV endpoint (usually `https://your-instance.demandware.net/on/demandware.servlet/webdav/Sites`)
   - **Authentication Type**: Choose between Basic Auth or Bearer Token
   - **Credentials**: Enter your username/password or bearer token

### Connecting to SFCC
1. Select a saved connection from the sidebar
2. Click the connect button (plug icon)
3. Once connected, you can browse files and folders

### File Operations
- **Navigate**: Double-click folders to enter them

- **Download**: Click the download button next to any file
- **Create Folder**: Click the folder+ button and enter a name
- **Delete**: Click the trash button next to any file/folder

### SFCC Quick Navigation
Use the predefined SFCC folders in the sidebar for quick access to common directories:
- Click any folder name to navigate directly to that path
- These folders follow SFCC best practices and standard project structure

## Security Features

### Credential Storage
- **OS Integration**: Leverages your operating system's secure credential storage
- **Encryption**: Additional AES encryption layer for sensitive data
- **Separation**: Public data (URLs, names) stored separately from sensitive credentials
- **Auto-cleanup**: Secure removal of credentials when connections are deleted

### Best Practices
- Credentials are never stored in plain text
- All sensitive operations use secure IPC communication
- No sensitive data is logged or exposed in the interface
- Regular security updates through Electron framework

## Configuration

### WebDAV URLs
Common SFCC WebDAV URL patterns:
- Production: `https://your-instance.demandware.net/on/demandware.servlet/webdav/Sites`
- Staging: `https://staging-your-instance.demandware.net/on/demandware.servlet/webdav/Sites`
- Development: `https://dev-your-instance.demandware.net/on/demandware.servlet/webdav/Sites`

### Bearer Tokens
For Account Manager integration:
1. Generate an API token in SFCC Account Manager
2. Select "Bearer Token" as authentication type
3. Paste your token in the Bearer Token field

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Connection Failed**
- Verify your WebDAV URL is correct
- Check your credentials are valid
- Ensure your SFCC instance allows WebDAV connections
- Verify network connectivity

**Certificate Errors**
- Some SFCC instances may have SSL certificate issues
- Contact your SFCC administrator for proper SSL configuration

**Permission Denied**
- Ensure your SFCC user has appropriate permissions
- Check with your SFCC administrator about WebDAV access rights

### Debug Mode
Run the application with debug information:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This opens the Developer Tools for debugging.
